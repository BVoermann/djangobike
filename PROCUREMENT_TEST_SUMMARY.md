# Procurement System Test Coverage Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive test suite ensuring the Einkauf (Procurement) tab dropdown menus work correctly and purchases are properly stored in the Lager (warehouse).

## Test Files
- `procurement/tests.py` - Original procurement system tests (31 tests)
- `procurement/test_dropdown_filtering.py` - New dropdown and filtering tests (10 tests)

## Test Coverage Summary

### 🎯 **Dropdown Menu Functionality Tests**
✅ **Supplier Dropdown** - Verifies all suppliers appear with correct data (quality, delivery time, prices)
✅ **Bike Type Dropdown** - Confirms all bike types are available for filtering
✅ **Component Filtering** - Tests that bike type selection properly filters components

### 🔍 **Component Filtering by Bike Type Tests**
✅ **City Bike Filtering** - Shows only basic components (no motors, no premium parts)
✅ **Sport Bike Filtering** - Shows sport/premium components (carbon frames, advanced gearshifts)  
✅ **E-Bike Filtering** - Includes motors and e-bike specific components
✅ **Racing Bike Filtering** - Only premium racing components (carbon, electronic gearshift)
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of empty requirements and edge cases

### 🏪 **Purchase Storage in Lager (Warehouse) Tests**
✅ **Warehouse Creation** - Automatic warehouse creation when first purchase is made
✅ **Component Stock Updates** - Components are properly added to warehouse inventory
✅ **Multiple Purchase Accumulation** - Quantities accumulate correctly across multiple orders
✅ **Storage Space Calculation** - Warehouse capacity and storage requirements computed correctly
✅ **Multiple Supplier Orders** - Components from different suppliers stored correctly

### 📦 **Procurement Order Management Tests**
✅ **Order Creation** - ProcurementOrder records created with correct details
✅ **Order Items** - Individual components tracked with quantities and prices
✅ **Session Balance Updates** - User balance reduced by purchase amounts
✅ **Transaction Atomicity** - Failed orders don't partially update database

### 🔄 **Integration Workflow Tests**
✅ **Complete Bike Production Workflow** - Filter → Purchase → Verify inventory for complete bike sets
✅ **E-Bike Component Purchasing** - End-to-end test for E-bike specific components
✅ **Sport Bike Component Set** - Comprehensive sport bike component purchasing
✅ **Multi-Supplier Coordination** - Components sourced from optimal suppliers

### ⚠️ **Error Handling & Validation Tests**
✅ **Invalid JSON Data** - Proper error responses for malformed requests
✅ **Invalid Supplier/Component IDs** - 404 handling for non-existent entities
✅ **Zero/Negative Quantities** - Validation prevents invalid quantity orders
✅ **Component Availability** - Prevents ordering unavailable component-supplier combinations
✅ **Empty Orders** - Graceful handling of empty order data

### 🎯 **Specific Test Scenarios Covered**

#### **Dropdown Menu Functionality:**
- ✅ Supplier dropdown shows all 4 suppliers with correct quality levels
- ✅ Bike type dropdown includes all bike types for filtering
- ✅ Component filtering correctly maps bike types to compatible components

#### **Component Filtering Accuracy:**
- ✅ **City Bike** → 5 basic components (no motors)
- ✅ **E-Bike** → 12 components including 3 motor types
- ✅ **Racing Bike** → Premium-only components (carbon frame, electronic gearshift)
- ✅ **Mountain Bike** → Sport components with advanced features

#### **Purchase → Warehouse Integration:**
- ✅ Purchase 10 basic wheels → Warehouse shows 10 wheels in stock
- ✅ Purchase from multiple suppliers → All components properly stored
- ✅ Multiple purchases → Quantities accumulate (5 + 7 = 12 wheels)
- ✅ E-bike complete set → All 6 component types stored correctly

#### **Storage & Capacity Management:**
- ✅ Warehouse capacity: 200m² (realistic size)
- ✅ Component storage calculation: 28m² for test purchase set
- ✅ Storage space per unit correctly applied for different component types

#### **Financial Integration:**
- ✅ Session balance: €80,000 → €78,100 after €1,900 purchase
- ✅ Multiple supplier costs aggregated correctly
- ✅ Transaction atomicity maintained on errors

## 🎉 **Test Results: 41/41 PASSING**
